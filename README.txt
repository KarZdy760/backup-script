Hello everyone, 

I've created these scripts to practice my bash scripting skills.

backup-script is a simple bash script for creating backups. You need to define the source path, destination, and file name in variables. The script also appends the date to the file name when executed.

delete-old-backups was created to find backups that are olders than 7 days and delete them from directory
